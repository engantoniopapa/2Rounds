Epidemic Protocol for Pure Decentralized P2P System

Epidemic protocol that limits the data flooding produced by membership information and requests for resources localisation. 
This protocol provides a set of messages and routing rules that allows the peers to communicate in a system 
completely decentralized. The network applications that use this protocol can improve the network coverage 
and control the data flooding.
